### Javascript functionality mimicking flush operation ðŸ˜†
There are 2 types of flush - Short and Long <br/>
Once you flush, you cannot immediately flush again! <br/>
Refilling starts immediately after flushing <br/>
Half way through the refill process, you can flush the little residue water available! <br/>
You can even peek outside and hear the birds chirping! <br/>
